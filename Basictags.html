            <Summary Style="color:rgba(222, 15, 15, 0.893);">Sundarbans &nbsp;Forest</Summary>
            <p1>The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world (140,000 ha), lies on the
                delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of
                India’s Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network
                of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an
                excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna,
                including 260 bird species, the Bengal tiger and other threatened species such as the estuarine
                crocodile and the Indian python.
                The Sundarbans Reserve Forest (SRF), located in the south-west of Bangladesh between the river Baleswar
                in the East and the Harinbanga in the West, adjoining to the Bay of Bengal, is the largest contiguous
                mangrove forest in the world. Lying between latitude 21° 27′ 30″ and 22° 30′ 00″ North and longitude 89°
                02′ 00″ and 90° 00′ 00″ East and with a total area of 10,000 km2, 60% of the property lies in Bangladesh
                and the rest in India. The land area, including exposed sandbars, occupies 414,259 ha (70%) with water
                bodies covering 187,413 ha (30%).
                The three wildlife sanctuaries in the south cover an area of 139,700 ha and are considered core breeding
                areas for a number of endangered species. Situated in a unique bioclimatic zone within a typical
                geographical situation in the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal, it is a landmark of ancient heritage
                of mythological and historical events. Bestowed with magnificent scenic beauty and natural resources, it
                is internationally recognized for its high biodiversity of mangrove flora and fauna both on land and
                water.
                The immense tidal mangrove forests of Bangladeshs Sundarbans Forest Reserve, is in reality a mosaic of
                islands of different shapes and sizes, perennially washed by brackish water shrilling in and around the
                endless and mind-boggling labyrinths of water channels. The site supports exceptional biodiversity in
                its terrestrial, aquatic and marine habitats; ranging from micro to macro flora and fauna. The
                Sundarbans is of universal importance for globally endangered species including the Royal Bengal Tiger,
                Ganges and Irawadi dolphins, estuarine crocodiles and the critically endangered endemic river terrapin
                (Batagur baska). It is the only mangrove habitat in the world for Panthera tigris tigris species.

        <details>&nbsp;<summary Style="color:rgba(222, 15, 15, 0.893);">Sacredgroves Forest</summary>
            <p1>The role of cultural and spiritual values is crucial to nature conservation. In India, over 1 million
                sacred forests and 100,000 to 150,000 sacred groves exist. These wilderness areas hold deep religious
                and spiritual meaning to Indian Hindu indigenous communities. In Hinduism, it is believed that nature
                worship is part of their moral obligations. Dating for centuries, many Hindus still practice tree
                worship to pay their respects to their deities and fulfil their wishes. According to their holy
                scriptures, Lord Brahma created all creatures and all are equal because they need each other to coexist.
                This spiritual belief is very similar to the mechanism of a healthy ecosystem. Many scientists believe
                that traditions and faiths like these are essential to encourage biodiversity conservation efforts.
                Sacred groves are found all over India - especially in states like Maharastra, Karnataka, Kerala, and
                Tamil Nadu. As a refuge for various plant and animal species, they are usually areas of natural
                vegetation resembling small forests and important sites for worship and community gatherings. Logging
                and hunting are strictly prohibited in these territories as Hindus don't believe in harming living
                creatures. Sacred groves are handled initially by native religious communities such as combined Hindu
                families or temple trusts.
                Dev Bhoomi - also known as the "Land of Gods" - is part of the 133 sacred groves at the foothills of the
                Himalayas in Uttarakhand. With its rivers, lakes, caves, and forests, it is considered the holiest land
                in the Himalayas. Communities honour local deities like Haat Kaali, Kotgyari Devi, Mahakaali, and more.
                Sacred groves in Uttarakhand are unique because they aren't usual forests but alpine meadows. The aspect
                of the holy grove might be different, but its purpose remains the same all over India. Local groups
                consider it as a part of their ethnic identity. That's why they believe these areas survive thanks to
                their local belief system, which is transmitted orally from generation to generation. There are no
                written records of their customary laws and taboos. Their belief system ensures that the sacred groves
                are not harmed in any way. It is forbidden to pluck flowers, uproot plants, harm animals, remove any
                religious objects</p1>

            <summary Style="color:rgba(222, 15, 15, 0.893);">Khasi Hills Forest</summary>
            <p1>
                Khasi Hills, physiographic region, central Meghalaya state, northeastern India. The area consists mostly
                of hilly regions and includes the Shillong Plateau; it is drained by tributaries of the Brahmaputra and
                Surma rivers. The Cherrapunji scarp in the south has one of the highest average annual rainfalls in the
                world. The Khasi Hills region is sometimes called the “Scotland of the East” because of its scenic
                beauty.
                The vast majority of the population outside of Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya state, are engaged in
                agriculture. The largest crop is wet rice, cultivated in the valleys and on hillside terraces. Other
                farmers in the region practice shifting cultivation, burning the trees and farming the land for one or
                two years before moving on. The government has discouraged this wasteful method, urging instead
                settlement on conventional farms. The distinctive culture of the Khasi people includes a traditional
                matrilineal social system that has been modified by outside religious and modern legal influences. Many
                of the hill peoples have become Christians.
                Meghalaya, state of India, located in the northeastern part of the country. It is bounded by the Indian
                state of Assam to the north and northeast and by Bangladesh to the south and southwest. The state
                capital is the hill town of Shillong, located in east-central Meghalaya.
