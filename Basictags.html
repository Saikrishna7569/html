       <Summary Style="color:rgba(222, 15, 15, 0.893);">Sundarbans &nbsp;Forest</Summary>
        <p1>The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world (140,000 ha), lies on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of India’s Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the Bengal tiger and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.
            The Sundarbans Reserve Forest (SRF), located in the south-west of Bangladesh between the river Baleswar in the East and the Harinbanga in the West, adjoining to the Bay of Bengal, is the largest contiguous mangrove forest in the world. Lying between latitude 21° 27′ 30″ and 22° 30′ 00″ North and longitude 89° 02′ 00″ and 90° 00′ 00″ East and with a total area of 10,000 km2, 60% of the property lies in Bangladesh and the rest in India. The land area, including exposed sandbars, occupies 414,259 ha (70%) with water bodies covering 187,413 ha (30%).
            The three wildlife sanctuaries in the south cover an area of 139,700 ha and are considered core breeding areas for a number of endangered species. Situated in a unique bioclimatic zone within a typical geographical situation in the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal, it is a landmark of ancient heritage of mythological and historical events. Bestowed with magnificent scenic beauty and natural resources, it is internationally recognized for its high biodiversity of mangrove flora and fauna both on land and water.
            The immense tidal mangrove forests of Bangladeshs Sundarbans Forest Reserve, is in reality a mosaic of islands of different shapes and sizes, perennially washed by brackish water shrilling in and around the endless and mind-boggling labyrinths of water channels. The site supports exceptional biodiversity in its terrestrial, aquatic and marine habitats; ranging from micro to macro flora and fauna. The Sundarbans is of universal importance for globally endangered species including the Royal Bengal Tiger, Ganges and Irawadi dolphins, estuarine crocodiles and the critically endangered endemic river terrapin (Batagur baska).  It is the only mangrove habitat in the world for Panthera tigris tigris species.

    <center><details>&nbsp;<summary Style="color:rgba(222, 15, 15, 0.893);">Sacredgroves Forest</summary>
    <p1>The role of cultural and spiritual values is crucial to nature conservation. In India, over 1 million sacred forests and 100,000 to 150,000 sacred groves exist. These wilderness areas hold deep religious and spiritual meaning to Indian Hindu indigenous communities. In Hinduism, it is believed that nature worship is part of their moral obligations. Dating for centuries, many Hindus still practice tree worship to pay their respects to their deities and fulfil their wishes. According to their holy scriptures, Lord Brahma created all creatures and all are equal because they need each other to coexist. This spiritual belief is very similar to the mechanism of a healthy ecosystem. Many scientists believe that traditions and faiths like these are essential to encourage biodiversity conservation efforts.
        Sacred groves are found all over India - especially in states like Maharastra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. As a refuge for various plant and animal species, they are usually areas of natural vegetation resembling small forests and important sites for worship and community gatherings. Logging and hunting are strictly prohibited in these territories as Hindus don't believe in harming living creatures. Sacred groves are handled initially by native religious communities such as combined Hindu families or temple trusts.
        Dev Bhoomi - also known as the "Land of Gods" -  is part of the 133 sacred groves at the foothills of the Himalayas in Uttarakhand. With its rivers, lakes, caves, and forests, it is considered the holiest land in the Himalayas. Communities honour local deities like Haat Kaali, Kotgyari Devi, Mahakaali, and more. Sacred groves in Uttarakhand are unique because they aren't usual forests but alpine meadows. The aspect of the holy grove might be different, but its purpose remains the same all over India. Local groups consider it as a part of their ethnic identity. That's why they believe these areas survive thanks to their local belief system, which is transmitted orally from generation to generation. There are no written records of their customary laws and taboos. Their belief system ensures that the sacred groves are not harmed in any way. It is forbidden to pluck flowers, uproot plants, harm animals, remove any religious objects</p1></details></center>
    <center> <details><summary Style="color:rgba(222, 15, 15, 0.893);">Khasi Hills Forest</summary><p1>
        Khasi Hills, physiographic region, central Meghalaya state, northeastern India. The area consists mostly of hilly regions and includes the Shillong Plateau; it is drained by tributaries of the Brahmaputra and Surma rivers. The Cherrapunji scarp in the south has one of the highest average annual rainfalls in the world. The Khasi Hills region is sometimes called the “Scotland of the East” because of its scenic beauty.
        The vast majority of the population outside of Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya state, are engaged in agriculture. The largest crop is wet rice, cultivated in the valleys and on hillside terraces. Other farmers in the region practice shifting cultivation, burning the trees and farming the land for one or two years before moving on. The government has discouraged this wasteful method, urging instead settlement on conventional farms. The distinctive culture of the Khasi people includes a traditional matrilineal social system that has been modified by outside religious and modern legal influences. Many of the hill peoples have become Christians.
        Meghalaya, state of India, located in the northeastern part of the country. It is bounded by the Indian state of Assam to the north and northeast and by Bangladesh to the south and southwest. The state capital is the hill town of Shillong, located in east-central Meghalaya.

   <center> <details><Summary Style="color:rgba(222, 15, 15, 0.893);"> Namdapha Forest</Summary><p1>
    Introduction: Namdapha Tiger Reserve was declared in the year 1983 as the 15th Tiger Project of the country with a core area of 1985.245 Sq.Km and a buffer area of 245 Sq.Km. Thus the total area of the Reserve is 1985 Sq.Km. Namdapha is in fact the name of a river which originates from Daphabum (Dapha is the name of hill, Bum means peak of hill) and meets Noa-Dehing river. This river flows right across in a North-South direction of the National Park and hence the name Namdapha has been given.
    Location: The area is bounded between the 27°23´N to 27°39´N latitude and 96°15´E to 96°58´E longitude. Namdapha National Park & Tiger Reserve is located in the Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. The area covered by the Namdapha Tiger Reserve was originally a reserve forest. It was declared a Wildlife Sanctuary under the Assam Forest Regulation 1891 on 2nd Oct.’1972. It was later declared a National Park on 12th May 1983, under Wildlife (Protection) Act1972. In the same year it was declared as a tiger reserve under Project Tiger Scheme of the Govt. of India on 15th March’1983.. Biogeographically, the area falls within the Eastern Himalayan (2D) biogeographic province of the Himalayas Biogeographic zone in the Indian Biogeographic Region which covers the Plaearctic Realm and the Indo-Malayan (Oriental) Realm (Rodgers and Power, 1988). It is located at the junction of the Indian Sub-Continent Biogeograhic region and the Indo-China Biogeographic Region (Dinerstein, E. et at 1997). As a result of this, extensive diversity of flora and fauna is observed in this belt. The Biomes recognised are evergreen Forests, Moist deciduous forests, sub-tropical forests, Temperate Forests and Alpine. The Namdapha protected area is wedged between Dapha Bum ridge of Mishmi Hills, of North Eastern Himalayas and Patkai Ranges.
    Vegetation: The unique geographical position, varied topography, high annual precipitation spreading throughout the year have made this virgin forest very rich in floral diversity wherein not a single species can be termed as the dominant species of the area. The climate condition with favorable rainfall coupled with temperature gradients and high humidity makes the vegetation characteristic of tropical evergreen forests (Tropical Rain Forests) although the region is located 270N of geographical equator. The flora of Namdapha protected areas is exceptionally rich, dense and diverse in species composition. It supports several endemics that have evolved locally or have survived only because of protective natural barriers against the invaders. In the phytogeographical relationship and affinities, the flora of Namdapha Protected Area show greater affinities with Indo-Malayan flora, although it also harbors the plants of other part of India, neighbouring as well as far off countries along with its own flora. On the basis of survey carried out in parts of this Protected Area it is found that there are 73 species of lichens, 59 species of Bryophytes, 112 species of Heridophytes, 5 species of Gymnosperons and around 801 species of Angiosperms (Sharma et. Al 1990). These do not include the floral elements of temperate and alpine regions that has not been explored due to inaccessibility and lack of infrastructure.
